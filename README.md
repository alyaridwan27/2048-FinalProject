## Rules and Controls
- The game is played on a 4x4 grid, with tiles that can contain a number value.
- The goal of the game is to merge tiles with the same number value until you reach a tile with the value of 2048.
- At the start of the game, two random tiles will appear on the grid with a value of 2 or 4.
- The player can move the tiles on the grid by using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
- When the player makes a move, the tiles will shift in the chosen direction and merge with any other tiles with the same value.
- After each move, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 will appear randomly on the grid.
- The player's score is calculated by adding up the values of the merged tiles.
- If the player can't make any more moves and there are no empty cells, the game is over.
- If the player reaches the 2048 tile the game is won.
